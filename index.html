		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
		    I am a lecturer in artificial intelligence at the University of Bristol since October 2025. 
			Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of 
			<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/elkind-edith.html">Edith Elkind</a> at the University of Oxford between September 2023 and September 2025. 
			Before that, I obtained a PhD degree from the Technical University of Munich under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dss/brandt/">Felix Brandt</a>. 
			My PhD thesis is on <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1692636/document.pdf">Computing Desirable Outcomes in Coalition Formation</a>. I also hold a master's degree in Mathematics from TU Munich.
			<br><br>
			I have a particular interest in topics related to computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, combinatorial algorithms, and computational complexity. My research covers various scenarios in multi-agent systems with a focus on coalition formation. Other topics that I study include matching markets, the emergence of segregation, understanding polarization, and voting theory. While I mostly apply algorithmic methods (like the efficient computability and computational boundaries of solution concepts), I am also intrigued by socio-scientific and philosophical paradigms.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;">
	  Together with <a href="https://matthias-greger.de">Matthias Greger</a> (Université Paris Dauphine), I am organising the working group <strong>From Democracy to Dating: Algorithm Design for Societal Challenges</strong> in a summer school run by the <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de/en">German Academic Scholarship Foundation</a>. Applications are invited by current and recent UK undergrad students (after their second year) and PhD students, and can be submitted <a href="https://studienstiftung.limequery.com/674112?lang=en">here</a>. Participants who are external to the scholarship foundation participate <strong>free of charge</strong> (including accommodation in the beautiful college)! Get in touch with me for more information, e.g., access to the complete program. The application deadline is <strong>1st March 2026</strong>.
